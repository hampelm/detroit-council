This app is a first try at parsing the full pdf for the Detroit Journal of City Council. The Journal is an official record of all meeting proceedings, and is only available in hardcopy at the City Clerk's office. We requested a copy of the electronic version on February 3, 2010 and received a copy shortly after September 28, over 230 days later. 

Unfortunately, the text version of the PDF is not easily parsable, so this app is not live online.
