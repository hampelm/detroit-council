Garden notes

There's not much left to do this year. The garden can use a 15 to 20-minute every day or two when it hasn't rained. 

The compost can be turned every second or third week. Lay out a tarp, lift the container off the base, and shovel all the compost onto the tarp. Replace the container, and shovel the compost back in. This process mixes in less-decayed materials, but more importantly, it oxygenates the material. Oxygen makes for faster and less smelly decomposition.

In the Fall, do not put the dead & wilted tomato plants into the compost. Instead, throw them in the trash. They can carry blight that will live on in the soil and the compost. Everything else can be composted or dug straight into the soil.

If you're feeling energetic, put leaves on top of the ground and turn over the soil before it freezes.

Next year

We are in (climate) zone 6. See the U of I Extension planting calendar for a good schedule. Start with April and work your way forward to May: http://urbanext.illinois.edu/gardencal/april.html

Rotate the crops. Plant things where they haven't been in the past. 

Tomatoes should under no circumstances be planted where they were this year. They have been in that spot for a couple years, which means they're susceptible to a bacteria that can infect the soil for about a decade. 

A couple excellent choices for that sunny space are: snap peas, green beans, or any other kind of legume. You can grow them on a tepee made of long (7 ft+) poles or branches, which will look impressive. Legumes add nitrogen to the soil (see also: George Washington Carver). Plant them in early May, before the 15th.

Plant the spinach early in the Spring, or the weather will get too hot too soon! Spinach turns bitter in the heat.

Use the compost. Even if it is not 100% decomposed, you can still dig in a healthy shovelful with each plant. Shovelful, not trowelful. Having little eggshell shards, etc. mixed in is quite normal.
